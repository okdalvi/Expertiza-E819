1. Problem Statement: Students should be allowed to suggest links for topics on the signup sheet in Expertiza. Ultimately, they will be able to get credit if they provide good suggestions. Each student/team working on a project will be able to access the suggested links for their topic, and rate the links based on how helpful they were. After each completed rating the average of all the ratings till then will be calculated and displayed along with each bookmark.
1.1 Limitations of current system
1. A header says "Rate Bookmark using the Questionnaire". Need to change the name as it is too detailed.
2. Weight adding feature needs to be added related to each response.
3. Bookmarks are enabled for all assignments. Add checkbox to allow one to enable bookmarks for an assignments; they are disabled by default.
4. Average of ratings needs to be calculated and populated at the right place.
5. Users are presently not able to vote for a bookmark as a part of the extra credit functionality to be implemented by the system. That Voting mechanism needs to be added along with displaying the number of votes for each bookmark.
6. The UI needs to be improved by directing to the proper screens instead of too many intermediate screens.
7. Tests need to be written.
